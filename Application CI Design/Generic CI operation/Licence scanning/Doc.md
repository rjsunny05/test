## 1. Introduction
- License scanning is a critical process in software development that ensures compliance with open-source and third-party licenses. It involves identifying, tracking, and managing licenses associated with dependencies used in a project.

- Integrating license scanning into Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines automates compliance checks, reducing legal risks and ensuring adherence to licensing obligations. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on implementing license scanning in CI workflows.

## 2. Why License Scanning?

- **Legal Compliance:** Avoid violations of open-source licenses (e.g., GPL, MIT, Apache).

- **Risk Mitigation:** Prevent lawsuits, fines, or forced source code disclosures.

- **Security:** Some licenses may impose restrictions affecting software distribution.

- **Transparency:** Maintain an audit trail of third-party dependencies.

- **CI/CD Integration:** Automate checks to catch issues early in development.
